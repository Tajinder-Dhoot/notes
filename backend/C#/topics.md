# High Level Concepts
## Core C# Concepts
### Basic Syntax:
- Data types, variables, constants, type inference (var and dynamic), nullable types.
- Control flow: if, switch, loops (for, while, foreach).

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Classes, objects, and constructors.
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, internal).

### Key Concepts:
- static vs instance members.
- readonly vs const.
- Value types vs reference types.
- Boxing and unboxing.
- Exception handling (try-catch-finally, custom exceptions).

## Advanced C# Features
### LINQ (Language Integrated Query):
- Query syntax vs method syntax.
- Common methods: Where, Select, GroupBy, OrderBy, Any, All, Aggregate.
- Deferred execution.

### Delegates, Events, and Lambdas:
- Multicast delegates.
- Action, Func, Predicate.
- Events and event handling.

### Generics:
- Generic classes, methods, and constraints.

### Collections:
- Common collections: List, Dictionary, HashSet, Queue, Stack.
- Differences between IEnumerable, ICollection, and IList.

### Asynchronous Programming:
- async and await.
- Task-based programming (Task, Task<T>).
- Understanding IAsyncEnumerable.

### Reflection:
- Dynamic type inspection and invoking members at runtime.

### Memory Management:
- Garbage collection.
- IDisposable and the using statement.
- Finalizers (~Destructor).

### Design Patterns and Best Practices
### Common design patterns:
- Singleton, Factory, Repository, Dependency Injection.
- SOLID principles.
- DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles.
- Writing clean, maintainable code.

## Frameworks and Libraries
### ASP.NET Core (if relevant to the job):
- Basics of web application development.
- Dependency injection.
- Middleware, routing, and controllers.

### Entity Framework Core:
- Database context and migrations.
- LINQ-to-Entities.
- Lazy loading vs eager loading.

### Testing Frameworks:
- Unit testing with MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit.
- Mocking frameworks like Moq.

## Problem-Solving and Algorithm Skills
### Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars.
- Focus on:
    - Array manipulation.
    - String handling.
    - Recursion and backtracking.
    - Sorting and searching algorithms.
    - Data structures: stacks, queues, dictionaries, and trees.

## Debugging and Optimization
- Familiarize yourself with debugging tools in Visual Studio.
- Understand performance optimization techniques (e.g., minimizing memory usage, avoiding unnecessary object creation).

## System Design and Architecture
- Understand how to design scalable and maintainable applications.
- Basics of microservices and REST APIs.
- Designing databases and understanding normalization.

## Behavioral and Soft Skills
- Be prepared to explain your past projects and contributions.
- Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for answering behavioral questions.
- Be clear and concise in explaining technical concepts.

## Sample Questions
### Core Concepts:
- Explain the difference between abstract classes and interfaces.
- What is the difference between ref and out parameters?

### Advanced C#:
- How does garbage collection work in C#?
- What is the purpose of the async keyword, and how does it work?

### Design Patterns:
- Can you explain the Singleton pattern and provide an example?
- How would you implement Dependency Injection in C#?

### Practical Coding:
- Write a function to reverse a string.
- Given a list of integers, return the indices of two numbers that add up to a specific target.
