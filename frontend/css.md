## Tailwind CSS
### Key Features of Tailwind CSS:
- **Utility-First Classes:** Instead of writing custom CSS, you use predefined utility classes like text-center, bg-blue-500, p-4, etc.
- **Customization:** Tailwind can be easily customized via its configuration file (tailwind.config.js). You can define custom colors, spacing, breakpoints, etc.
- **Responsive Design:** Built-in support for responsive design with classes like sm:, md:, lg:, and more.
- **Dark Mode: Simplifies dark mode implementation with dark: variants.
- **No Opinionated Components:** Unlike other frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap), it doesn't come with pre-styled components, making it more flexible for custom designs.
- **Just-in-Time Mode (JIT):** Tailwind's JIT compiler generates CSS on-demand, resulting in smaller CSS bundles and faster build times.
