## HTML, CSS, and Web Fundamentals
### HTML:
- Semantic HTML and accessibility `(<header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>)`.
- Forms and validation `(<input>, <textarea>, <select>`, attributes like required, pattern).
- Proper use of alt for images and ARIA roles for accessibility.

### CSS:
- Box model, Flexbox, and CSS Grid for layouts.
- Positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky).
- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements (:hover, ::after, etc.).
- Media queries and responsive design techniques.
- CSS preprocessors (like SASS/SCSS).
- Common CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind).

### Web Fundamentals:
- Understanding of DOM (Document Object Model).
- Browser rendering pipeline (critical rendering path).
- HTTP/HTTPS, caching, and cookies.

## JavaScript and ES6+
### Core JavaScript:
- Variables (var, let, const).
- Data types, coercion, and typeof.
- Scope, closures, and the this keyword.
- Event delegation and bubbling.
- DOM manipulation with vanilla JS (querySelector, addEventListener).

### ES6+ Features:
- Arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and rest/spread operators.
- Promises, async/await, and error handling.
- Modules (import/export).
- Classes and inheritance.

### Browser APIs:
- Fetch API and working with REST APIs.
- LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB.
- WebSockets and real-time communication basics.

## Frameworks and Libraries
### React (or relevant library):
- Components (functional and class-based).
- Props, state, and lifecycle methods.
- Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
- Context API and state management libraries like Redux, Zustand, or MobX.
- React Router for navigation.

### Other Libraries/Frameworks:
- Basics of Vue.js or Angular if relevant to the role.
- Utility libraries like Lodash and Moment.js.
## Testing
- Unit testing with frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine.
- Component testing with React Testing Library or Enzyme.
- End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright.

## Build Tools and Version Control
- Webpack, Vite, or Parcel for bundling.
- Babel for transpilation.
- Version control with Git (branching, merging, resolving conflicts).
- Package managers like npm or Yarn.

## Performance Optimization
- Reducing reflows and repaints.
- Image optimization and lazy loading.
- Code splitting and dynamic imports.
- Minification and tree-shaking.
- Debouncing and throttling.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- WCAG guidelines.
- Screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- ARIA roles and attributes.

## Problem-Solving and Algorithms
- Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank.
- Focus on array, string, and DOM manipulation problems.

#### Example:
- Flatten a nested array.
- Debounce a function.

## System Design (Frontend-Focused)
- Designing responsive and scalable web applications.
- Component-driven design.
- Managing state efficiently.
- Designing for reusability (atomic design principles).

- How would you create a two-column layout using CSS Grid?
- What are the differences between inline, block, and inline-block elements?

### JavaScript:
- Explain how closures work in JavaScript.
- What is the difference between call, apply, and bind?

### React:
- How does the useEffect hook work?
- What is the difference between debouncing and throttling?
